# Ping-Pong-Game
it's a ping pong game. might get fancy. It's in Python.

# How should it work?
- A/D or the mouse going left/right as movement for paddles
- Exit button on window should close the game
- Spacebar/Esc should pause it


# How should the game look like?
- Black background, white paddle and top wall
- Screen should be 800 x 800 px in size
- Ball is white, and has a constant speed

The vibes of it should feel like a old arcade game

# Goals for me
- make the ping pong game       ( 0/1 )
- optimize the ping pong game   ( 0/1 )

( 0/2 done as of 19/02/2025 )
