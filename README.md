# Ping-Pong-Game
it's a ping pong game. might get fancy. It's in Python.

# How should it work?
- A/D or the mouse going left/right as movement for paddles ( will do )
- Exit button on window should close the game               ( it works! )
- Spacebar/Esc should pause it                              ( will do )

# How should the game look like?
- Black background, white paddle and top wall               ( will do )
- Screen should be 800 x 800 px in size                     ( will do )
- Ball is white, and has a constant speed                   ( will do )

The vibes of it should feel like a old arcade game
